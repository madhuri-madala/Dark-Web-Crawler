Ensure you have Tor installed and running locally.
Configuration
Edit config.yaml to set:
- tor_proxy: e.g., socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050
- start_urls: List of seed .onion URLs
- crawl_depth: Max depth for recursive crawling
- output_format: json or sqlite
- keywords: Optional list for content filtering

🧪 Usage
python crawler.py --config config.yaml



📁 Output
Results are saved in the output/ directory with metadata including:
- Page title
- URL
- Internal and external links
- Keyword matches (if enabled)
- Crawl timestamp

🧠 Ethical Guidelines
- Do not engage with illegal marketplaces, forums, or services.
- Avoid downloading or storing illicit content.
- Respect robots.txt and site-specific crawl policies.
- Use anonymized environments for testing (e.g., Tails OS, VPN).
